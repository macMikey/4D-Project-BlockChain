# 4D-Project-BlockChain

This is a Simple BlockChain Project written in 4D v18 R4. This is mostly for education purpose.

You may be familiar with BlockChain, the technology that keeps the Bitcoin network secure. In trying to learn more about blockchain, you’ve probably encountered a definition like this: “blockchain is a distributed, immutable, decentralized, public, and transparent ledger" However, the concept of Blockchain can be used in a centralized, private and non-distributed environment as well. With thousands of applications in the real world, Blockchain is possibly one of the most interesting and disruptive technologies of the last decade.

I tried to demonstrate some design principles such as class design and reuse, compositions, polymorphic naming, and generic programming using the ‘OB Instance of’ method. This video tutorial was inspired by a video called ‘Creating a BlockChain in Javascript’ from ‘Simply Explained’ Youtube Channel.
